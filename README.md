## 🛠️ Task 1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
**Dataset:** Titanic  

### 🔑 Key Preprocessing Steps
- **Handling Missing Values**

  - Cabin → dropped (>77% missing)  
  - Fare → single missing value handled  

- **Converting Categorical Features**
  - Sex → label encoded (0/1)  
  - Embarked → one-hot encoded  
  - Title → extracted from passenger names  
  - Family Size → derived from SibSp + Parch  

- **Feature Engineering**
  - Title feature  
  - FamilySize feature  
  - IsAlone flag  
  - Binned Age & Fare
