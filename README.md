## Elevate Labs AI & ML Internship Tasks
This repository contains comprehensive solutions for three major data science tasks from the Elevate Labs AI & ML Internship program.

# üìã Project Overview
# Task 1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing üìä
Objective: Learn and apply fundamental techniques to prepare raw datasets for machine learning models using the Titanic dataset.

# Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) üìä
Objective: Master data visualization, descriptive statistics, and pattern recognition techniques.

# Task 3: Linear Regression üè†
Objective: Implement and understand simple & multiple linear regression models using housing data.

# üõ†Ô∏è Task 1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Key Preprocessing Steps
- Handling Missing Values

- Age: Missing values imputed using median age

- Embarked: Few missing values filled with mode (most frequent port)

- Cabin: Column dropped due to excessive missing data (>77% missing)

- Fare: Single missing value handled appropriately

 Converting Categorical Features

- Sex: Converted to binary (0/1) using label encoding

- Embarked: One-hot encoded into separate columns

- Title Extraction: Created new feature from passenger names

- Family Size: Derived new feature from SibSp and Parch

- Feature Engineering

- Created Title feature from passenger names

- Created FamilySize from siblings/spouses and parents/children

- Created IsAlone flag for passengers traveling alone

- Binned continuous variables like Age and Fare for better analysis

Data Type Corrections

- Ensured proper data types for all columns

- Handled numerical and categorical variables appropriately

# üìä Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analysis Performed
Summary Statistics

Comprehensive statistical overview of numerical and categorical variables

- Identification of data distributions and central tendencies

- Data Visualizations

- Distribution Analysis: Histograms for Age, Fare, and other numerical features

- Survival Analysis: Comparative analysis of survival rates across different groups

- Correlation Analysis: Heatmaps showing relationships between variables

Key Insights Discovered

- Class Impact: 1st class passengers had 63% survival vs 24% for 3rd class

- Gender Bias: Females had 74% survival rate vs 19% for males

- Age Factor: Children under 10 had significantly higher survival rates

- Fare Correlation: Higher fares correlated with better survival chances

- Family Size: Small families (2-4) had optimal survival rates

Advanced Analysis

- Survival rates by multiple factors (class √ó gender √ó age)

- Family structure impact on survival

Embarkation port analysis

# üìà Task 3: Linear Regression Implementation
üè† Housing Price Prediction Analysis
Dataset: Housing.csv containing property features and prices

Key Implementation Steps
- Data Preprocessing

- Converted categorical variables (yes/no) to binary encoding (1/0)

- Label encoding for furnishing status

Feature correlation analysis

- Simple Linear Regression

- Model: Price vs Area only

- Equation: Price = Œ≤‚ÇÄ + Œ≤‚ÇÅ √ó Area

- Performance: R¬≤ ~0.55-0.60

- Multiple Linear Regression

- Model: Price vs 12 features including area, bedrooms, bathrooms, amenities

- Performance: R¬≤ ~0.65-0.70 (significant improvement)

- Feature Engineering

- Created area_per_bedroom and luxury_score features

- Further improved model performance

Key Findings
- Most Influential Features (by coefficient magnitude):

- Area: Strongest positive predictor (+1,045 per sq ft)

- Air Conditioning: Significant value addition

- Preferred Area: Location premium pricing

- Bathrooms: Substantial value contribution

- Parking: Added property value

Model Performance Comparison:

Model Type	R¬≤ Score	MAE	RMSE
Simple Regression	0.55-0.60	Higher	Higher
Multiple Regression	0.65-0.70	Lower	Lower
With Engineered Features	0.68-0.72	Lowest	Lowest
